A script downloader for quick and dirty front-end prototyping.
No, really. All it does is look up the library on cdnjs, does
some scraping and then downloads the files for you. Usage::

    $ takeit jquery katex==0.5.1
    https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery
    [?] Download: 
    > o jquery.js
      o jquery.min.js
      o jquery.min.map
      o jquery.slim.js
      o jquery.slim.min.js
      o jquery.slim.min.map

*Take it away* (to the dungeon).
